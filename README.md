# German Cars Price and Efficiency Comparison
## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to examine the relationship between fuel consumption and various factors, including fuel type, horsepower (HP), transmission, mileage, manufacturing year, and price, across different car brands and models. This study aims to provide insights into how these attributes influence fuel efficiency in the German automotive market.

## Descriptions

Brand: BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche, and Opel.

Model: Details the specific model within each brand.

Year: The manufacturing year of each vehicle.

Mileage: The total kilometers each car has traveled.

Fuel Type: Specifies the type of fuel the car uses, including Petrol, Diesel, Electric, and Hybrid options.

Fuel Consumption (L/100km): Represents the vehicle’s average fuel consumption, in liters per 100 kilometers, ranging between 3.0 to 12.0 L/100km.

Horsepower (HP): The engine’s power rating in horsepower, with values from 70 to 500 HP.

Transmission: Manual or Automatic transmission.

Price (€): The price of the vehicle in euros.

City: Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, and Frankfurt.

## Key Questions
I aim to derive meaningful insights from data on the German automotive market, with a particular focus on answering the following key questions:

● Do certain brands and models exhibit higher fuel consumption?

● How do fuel type, horsepower, and transmission influence fuel consumption?

● To what extent do fuel consumption, horsepower, and mileage impact vehicle pricing?

## Data Set
